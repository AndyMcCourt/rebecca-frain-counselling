          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>
            Thank you for visiting Rebecca&nbsp;Frain&nbsp;Counselling. I believe
            therapy provides a safe and confidential space where you can talk to a
            trained professional about your issues and concerns. According to the
            British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), a
            therapist will help you explore your thoughts, feelings and behaviours
            so you can develop a better understanding of yourself and of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a counsellor, my role is not to give you advice or prescribe
            medication, but to help you find your own solutions in a way that
            respects your individuality. Whether you are experiencing stress,
            anxiety, loss or relationship difficulties, I am here to support you
            on your journey toward greater wellbeing.

          <h2>Why Choose Rebecca?</h2>
          <p>
            With professional training and a warm, empathetic approach, I
            prioritise creating a non‑judgemental environment where you can feel
            heard and understood. I am a member of the BACP and adhere to their
            ethical framework, ensuring that your wellbeing, autonomy and
            confidentiality are at the centre of our work together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clients appreciate my calm and welcoming manner, which helps them
            feel at ease as we explore challenges such as anxiety, low mood,
            self‑esteem or relationship issues. Sessions are tailored to your
            needs and usually last around 50 minutes.
