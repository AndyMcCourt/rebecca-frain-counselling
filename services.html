          <p>
            I offer a range of counselling services designed to support you in a
            way that fits your life. Sessions typically last around 50 minutes
            and take place at a pace that feels right for you. We will work
            collaboratively to understand your experiences and help you find a
            path forward.

        <h2>Individual Counselling</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            One‑to‑one sessions provide a private space where you can explore
            personal challenges, thoughts and emotions. Whether you’re feeling
            overwhelmed by anxiety, coping with bereavement or wanting to
            understand patterns in your relationships, individual counselling
            offers a supportive environment to gain insight and develop coping
            strategies.

        <h2>Relationship Counselling</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Relationship or couples counselling helps partners work through
            difficulties together. Sessions provide a neutral space to improve
            communication, rebuild trust and understand each other’s needs more
            clearly. I also offer family sessions to support healthy dynamics
            and address conflicts.

        <h2>Online & Telephone Counselling</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            For clients who prefer the flexibility of remote sessions or cannot
            attend in person, I provide counselling via secure video call or
            telephone. This can be particularly helpful if you have mobility
            difficulties, live outside the Lymm area or simply want to engage in
            therapy from the comfort of your home. Therapy can take place face to
            face, online or over the telephone and may involve specific
            exercises or more general discussions depending on your needs.
